## 🔍 About  
I'm currently learning and building small projects to strengthen my understanding of **Data Science concepts**.  
This repo will grow as I:  
- Explore **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**  
- Practice with **real datasets**  
- Learn **Machine Learning** and **Neural Networks** 
- Document my notes, code, and experiments
